What is Helm?

1) Package Manager for Kubernetes
  To pack YAML Files and distribute them in public and private repositories

******
Tip: The complete helm/helm library is written in GoLang by Google
******

Example, WE HAVE TO DEPLOY ELASTICK STACK FOR lOGGING then one will have to create Stateful Set, ConfigMap, Secret, K8s user with permissions, Services
then this bundle od YAML files will be pretty standard throughout differenct deployments so people decided
to create such bundles of YAML files and call them Helm Charts.

So, Helm Charts are:
  -Bundle of YAML Files
  -Create your own Helm Charts with Helm
  -Push them to the Helm Repositories
  -Download and use already present Helm Charts.
  
 Can use the following links:
 - Helm hub: https://hub.helm.sh/
 - Helm charts GitHub Project: https://github.com/helm/charts
 - Installing Helm: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/
 - Helm v3 release notes: https://helm.sh/blog/helm-3-released/

2) Templating Engine:
  To create single templates for multiple microservices with almost same config file
  except a few differencess.
  
  Exapmle, If we have 100 microservices and all of them differ only in port, image and name tag then rather than creating 100 yaml files 
  different for each microservice, we can create one Helm template and use it for all.
  The template file is created as 1. Define a common blueprint
                                  2. Dynamic values are replaced by placeholders( these values look like {{ .Values.container.name }}
                                     and are stored in a separate file called values.yaml)
                                
3) Use same application in differenct environments:
  Create your own Helm charts for test environment and use that to deploy the application on prod and dev clusters using own Helm charts.


===================================
Keywords in Helm
===================================

1. CHART: It is a helm package, it contains all the yaml resource definations necessary to run an application

2. RELEASE: A release is an instance of a chart running in K8's. One chart can be installed many times into the same 
            cluster and each time it is installed, a new RELEASE is created. Helm keeps track of all chart executions.
           
3. REPOSITORY: Location where the package is installed.


===================================

HELM -3 ARCHITECHTURE

===================================

-It is a single-service architecture, one executable is responsible for implementing HELM. There is no client-server(tiller) split like HELM-2 
nor is the core processiong logic distributed among components.

-Implementation of HELM-3 is a single command line, client with no in-cluster server or controller. This tool exposes command-line
operations and unilaterally handles the package management process.


===================================

Helm Chart Structure

====================================

Directory Structure
mychart/            : Top level folder => name of chart
  Chart.yaml        : meta info about the chart
  values.yaml       : values for the template files
  charts  folder    : chart dependencies
  templates folder  : the actual template files

after running commands helm install <chartname> the template files willbe filled with the values from values.yaml


===================================
Value Injection Into Template Files
===================================

values.yaml           my-values.yaml      =     .Values object 
imageName: myapp       version: 2.0.0             imageName: myapp
port: 8080                                        port: 8080
version: 1.0.2                                    version: 2.0.0
  
  default                 override values
  
after running helm install --values=my-values.yaml <chartname> .Values object is created


                                OR
                                
                                
 We can run the command helm install --set version=2.0.0
